**WiseGlot is a mobile application for learning and practising languages using artificial intelligence interacting with the OpenAI API.**

The application aims to offer an innovative alternative for language learning, taking into account the user's preferences and topics of interest in order to offer attractive content that keeps them interested in continuing to learn.

For now, the app offers two study methods:

- Learning vocabulary and new phrases through flash cards generated with artificial intelligence based on the user's tastes.

- Dialogue with an artificial intelligence model through a chat that corrects and explains your way of communicating and establishes a conversation in the language you want to learn.

> University thesis project for the degree of computer engineering. Still in development.
